Adding two strings will put them together, numbers will be added ie. "Fish"+"Lips" = Fish Lips,  3 + 5 = 8
adding a string and a number will put them together ie. "Samantha Miller" + 19 = Samantha Miller 19.

If you use age = "7" as a string and try to add it to yourAge = 37 you will get 737 unless you use one of the following
parseInt(age) + Number(yourAge) + yourAge*1);
They cast the value to the data type you want it to be
Can only use parseInt() if changing a string to a number 

\t stands for tab it will put information farther out
\n stands for new line, it will start a new line

prompt(); will ask for user input
prompts always bring back strings, 100% of the time so parseInt(), Number() or *1 may be needed.
